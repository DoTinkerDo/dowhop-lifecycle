## Practices

We recommend that contributors open a pull request and require a review by another member of the team for adding in new features. For bug squashing, we can discuss this on a case-by-case basis.

General stylings regarding best code practices **coming soon**. For now:

* Use DRY code (i.e., "Do Not Repeat Yourself")
* Commit often and clearly (e.g., "Add X to Y so that Z")
* Embrace Agile development

Feel free to reach out. We strive to be **daring** and **kind**!
