## Preferred Practices

### Overview

We approach development using an Agile philosophy. We try to commit often, communicate clearly, and embrace DoWhop's core values of being kind, bold, and daring.

### GitHub

Branching
* Our approach is to name a branch using your name followed by a dash followed by the feature and/or page you're working on. For example, `keaton-add-profile-icons` or `erik-update-dowhop-create-form`.

Committing
* Write clear messages in the active voice (e.g., "Add profile nickname edit form"). Commit often so that other members of the team can easily know what you did.

Pull Requests
* When submitting a pull request, please tag another member of the team for a code review. That member should test the code locally before approving and merging the request.


### Coding

General stylings regarding best code practices **coming soon**. For now:

* Use DRY code (i.e., "Do Not Repeat Yourself")
* Commit often and early
* Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Add X to Y so that Z")
* Name branches starting with your own name
* Push up branches at the end of the day
* Embrace Agile development
